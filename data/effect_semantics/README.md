# Optional per-unit modifier reference

Patch **8.1.1**, Steam build **24237342**. This first pass organizes the **entire
220-table extraction**, preserves all 109,408 decoded rows, and applies one
retrieval model across all 1,669 distinct units in the existing normalized roster.
It is a source-backed reference, not an active campaign-state or final-stat calculator.

## Retrieve only the layer needed

1. **Base unit:** keep using `data/unit_stats/normalized/`. The `unit` command below
   reads that dataset directly and never opens the modifier database.
2. **Modifier index:** use `unit_index.csv`, then the paginated `--modifiers`
   query. It returns a compact bonus-type summary, potential relationships,
   source counts, rank bounds, scope keys and links to shared details.
3. **Shared details:** follow `effect`, `source`, or `record`. These expose exact
   bindings, source values, owner/variant/node references, scope fields and raw
   schema references. No full skill or technology tree is copied into each unit.

Python 3.10+ (standard library only) and Node 24+ are required for build/validation.
On Windows, use the installed Python executable in place of `python3` if needed.

```bash
# Base comparison: no campaign-reference load.
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py unit wh2_main_hef_inf_lothern_sea_guard_0

# Candidate modifiers, filtered to sources owned by Teclis, at unit rank 7.
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py unit wh2_main_hef_inf_lothern_sea_guard_0 --modifiers --owner wh2_main_hef_teclis --rank 7 --limit 10

# Narrow further with --bonus ammo_mod or --source-kind technology.
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py effect wh2_main_effect_force_stat_ammunition_hef_archer_seaguard_boltthrower_sister_shadow --owner wh2_main_hef_teclis

# Substitute returned IDs; IDs are local to the manifest's snapshot.
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py source 1 --limit 10
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py record 1 --limit 5

# Browse the full extraction or the observed gaps without expanding a unit dossier.
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py inventory --limit 20
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py table unit_experience_bonuses_tables
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py gaps --kind effects --limit 10
python3 scripts/query-modifier-reference.py gaps --kind sets --limit 10
```

Every potentially long result is paginated (`--limit`, `--offset`, `next_offset`).
The default is 10; the hard limit is 100. Keys are exact game keys, not guessed
labels. `--owner` selects the character subtype or faction **owning the source**;
it does not establish recruitment access, current ownership or effect scope.
An effect page retains all of that effect's target bindings even when source
ownership is filtered. Scope may restrict a nominal unit-set match to the lord,
an army or another recipient: inspect it before treating a candidate as a buff.

The default unit view now omits **character-only source occurrences** for units
whose source caste is neither lord nor hero. Classification uses the retained
scope's `target` field, not its key or English label. An effect with both personal
and army sources keeps its army sources. `--evidence` restores personal sources;
`effect` and `source` always preserve them. Unknown/conditional recipient enums
remain visible as `unresolved_scope`. Force/army and faction classifications
describe recipients, not proof of active applicability. Character queries retain
personal sources, but **owner-to-character/mount identity is not resolved**: an
unrelated lord's source-owner filter is not proof that it can buff this character.
The compact CSV index counts unfiltered evidence, not this filtered query view.

## Files and ownership

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `unit_index.csv` | Small directory covering every normalized roster unit, with candidate counts |
| `reference.sqlite.gz` | Compressed generated query database; shared relations are stored once |
| `table_inventory.json` | All 220 source tables, classification and row totals |
| `schema_inventory.json` | Generated tables/views and their columns |
| `coverage_report.json` | Coverage, unresolved paths, counts and interpretation boundaries |
| `validation_report.json` | Latest successful reconciliation, locked to the dataset manifest |
| `dataset_manifest.json` | Hashes, input locks, snapshot and generator environment |
| `source_exports/` | Complete unchanged validated extraction, its schema and source manifest |

The query helper verifies hashes and decompresses the database into ignored
`work/modifier-reference-cache/` on first detail retrieval. Do not commit that
cache or load the whole database into an agent context. SQLite is the generated
query form; source exports and existing datasets retain their source authority.
The archive is about 16 MiB. Base records retain their existing schema and size.

`source_records` preserves every decoded field, including blanks, using JSON
objects; `schema_fields` retains types and references. `bindings`, `target_sets`,
`target_selectors`, `unit_targets`, `sources` and `source_occurrences` provide the
typed retrieval layer. `source_tables` assigns every extracted table a family.
Supporting visual/audio records remain retained and discoverable; they are not
forced into the per-unit modifier list merely because extraction followed a
schema dependency to them.

Skill/technology source definitions are deduplicated while their owner, node,
variant, rank and conditional occurrences remain separate. Existing source CSV
paths and physical row references lead back to the authoritative prerequisites
and locks. This is a derived join index, not a replacement skill/technology tree.
Native progression and ability tables are exposed as source evidence; future
normalized progression/ability datasets remain owned by `data/unit_stats/`.

## Consistent candidate rules

- Unit keys, source caste, source class and source category are taken from the
  unit dataset and its retained game tables. The curated `tactical_category`
  is not substituted into game targeting predicates.
- Selector rows and exclusions are retained verbatim. Within the candidate
  compiler, a definite exclusion overrides an inclusion. This explicit retrieval
  policy is not a claim to have traced engine precedence.
- A multi-field selector is a definite match only when all specified predicates
  match, a non-match when none match, and otherwise remains possible. Unknown
  AND/OR grouping is not silently invented. Special categories remain conditional.
- Sets without positive selectors are unresolved, never universal or proven empty.
  Sets with no matches in the normalized roster are distinguished from missing
  selector evidence. Explicit targets outside that roster remain in shared bindings.
- Rank bounds are preserved and applied only when `--rank` is supplied. They are
  unit experience levels, not lord skill levels.
- Direct unit/set references and the extracted set-to-ability/attribute/phase and
  missile-weapon-to-unit junctions support typed target paths. Existing base
  abilities and attributes support reverse candidate lookup. Arbitrary schema
  references are never treated as proof of who receives an effect.
- Ability grants are indexed by explicit recipient sets. Newly granted abilities
  are not recursively propagated into all later ability-modifier possibilities.
- Scope recipient classification separates demonstrably personal sources; active
  scope and acquisition remain unevaluated. A `selector_match` is a static source
  match, not a statement that the effect is active. Skill levels are alternatives;
  their values must not be summed. Faction variants are not simultaneous bonuses.
- Identifiers such as `*_mod` and `*_mult` are preserved as bonus keys; their
  spelling is not used to infer engine arithmetic, rounding, stacking or caps.

### Weapon activation and rank are separate questions

Every missile-weapon junction binding has `unresolved_weapon_activation` and
`unresolved_rank_activation`, with independently traced junction, weapon and
projectile evidence available on its effect page. These retained records establish
which weapon belongs to which unit; they do not establish the engine's activation
predicate. Such candidates remain visible at both queried ranks with null
`rank_match` and explicit unresolved eligibility. A route without a modeled rank
predicate is never labelled rank-eligible. Explicit unit-set rank predicates are
still applied, independently, and only certify that predicate rather than a buff.

For Seasoned Militia, both Sea Guard junctions lead to
`wh3_dlc27_hef_sea_guard_bow_anti_infantry`, whose default projectile is
`wh3_dlc27_hef_sea_guard_arrow_anti_infantry`. The retained weapon fields, projectile
fields and additional-projectile relation provide no rank activation predicate.
The reload binding independently targets `wh3_dlc27_hef_all_bow_inf_r7` with an
explicit 7–9 range. We do **not** transfer that range to the weapon-enable binding
or derive it from `_r7`/localized text. The unresolved question is the engine rule
governing the enabled weapon's rank-dependent selection, not a demonstrated game bug.
No additional extraction was performed or prescribed by this audit.

## First full coverage result

- 220 source tables / 109,408 rows preserved.
- 23,110 bindings retained; 14,850 have a supported typed unit-reference route.
  Of those, 10,411 have at least one candidate in the current normalized roster.
- All 1,669 roster units receive an index entry; the index is deliberately not a
  completeness certificate for all campaign modifiers.
- 19,241 distinct skill/technology effect-source definitions link to 153,930
  owner occurrences without flattening rank, node or faction-variant context.
- Scope recipients classify 10,182 definitions as character-only, 6,255 as
  force/army, 1,176 as faction context and 1,628 as unresolved recipient semantics.
  All 254 missile-weapon-junction bindings retain unresolved activation evidence.
- Among effects used by those sources, 4,908 have a supported unit-reference
  binding, 1,526 have retained bindings without that route, and 400 have no binding
  in this extraction. These are unique effect counts, not occurrence counts.
- 44 sets require special-category interpretation; 80 lack positive selectors;
  250 have no current roster match. One selector combines multiple fields.
- 89 explicit unit-target bindings refer outside the normalized roster.
- 115 schema-reference fields point to tables absent from both this extraction
  and the checked existing source snapshots. They may include engine enums;
  absence does not itself establish a missing export worth collecting.

The 8,260 bindings not indexed by unit include economic and other contextual
references as well as unresolved unit-related routes. Their target-type breakdown
is in the coverage report. `source_gaps` preserves indirect source references
such as initiative effects and unlocks; conditional effect rows already present
are indexed independently. These references are not all failed extractions.

The unbound-source-effect examples with the most source definitions are mount
unlocks (Chaos Steed, Barded Warhorse, Elven Steed, Great Eagle, Warshrine).
That is a concrete lead for subsequent investigation, not authorization to infer
their missing bindings. Use the gap queries to decide what merits more work.

## Reproduction and acceptance

```bash
python3 scripts/build-modifier-reference.py data/effect_semantics/source_exports work/modifier-candidate-new
python3 scripts/validate-modifier-reference.py work/modifier-candidate-new data/effect_semantics/source_exports
python3 scripts/test-modifier-reference.py work/modifier-candidate-new
```

The builder requires a fresh ignored output directory and first runs the existing
source-integrity validator. Promote the candidate artifacts only after validation
passes; preserve source bytes unchanged. Update catalog, manifest, schema inventory,
README and coverage together. Build twice in the same Python/SQLite environment
to check byte reproducibility; cross-version SQLite serialization can differ even
when logical data is identical. Gzip timestamps and filenames are fixed.

Validation reconciles every source row, every unit record and every owner effect
occurrence with the source snapshots, checks hashes and foreign keys, verifies the
compact index counts, and prevents explicit exclusions from leaking into candidates.
Focused tests cover Sea Guard variants vs spearmen, rank filtering, compound
selectors, exclusions, source-level alternatives, pagination and base-query isolation.
They also cover personal/army separation, mixed and unknown scopes, independently
unresolved weapon activation at ranks 6/7, and actual variant-specific bindings.

This fulfills the first organization pass under issue #7. It does not close that
issue: complete acquisition/compatibility, bespoke campaign systems, native rank
formulas and legal maximum-build comparisons remain open.
